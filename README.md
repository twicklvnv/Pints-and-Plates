# Pints-and-Plates

A group project with 3 other collaborators in which the user picks a beer style from a dropdown menu, and the app will return information on that given style of beer and a few random examples of that style. The app also returns suggested food pairings for that style of beer and the user can then pick one of the three suggested food pairings and the app will return five recipes using that food pairing.
